# E2E INTEGRATION TESTING

## Setup

## Flutter inspector
To debug a layout issue, run the app in debug mode and open the inspector by clicking the Flutter Inspector tab on the DevTools toolbar.

Note: You can still access the Flutter inspector directly from Android Studio/IntelliJ, but you might prefer the more spacious view when running it from DevTools in a browser.

Debugging layout issues visually
The following is a guide to the features available in the inspectorâ€™s toolbar. When space is limited, the icon is used as the visual version of the label.
